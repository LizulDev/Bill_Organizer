# BILL ORGANIZER IN C

A project which can make an organization in one's bills based on their names and values. 

## It features:

- Insertion of the name of the bill, as well as its value; 
- Visualization of the entire list included; 
- Exclusion of all the list after being used;
- Sum of all of the bills for a bigger control; 

## How was it built:

It was built in C language, which has the following libraries:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
```
*the first one enables inputs and outputs;

**the second one enables some functions in C native libraries;

***the third one enables some functions in C native libraries;

It includes a single-chained data structure, which was chosen due to the necessity of inserting both name and the value of each bill. 

### * Later updates will soon be released;
